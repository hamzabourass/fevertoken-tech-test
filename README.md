1. **Task 1 - CI/CD with GitHub Actions:** The first task involves demonstrating proficiency in setting up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using GitHub Actions. This part of the test showcases my ability to automate the build and deployment process efficiently.

2. **Task 2 - Programming Skills:** The second task assesses my programming skills. I'll be working on programming challenges or projects that demonstrate my coding abilities, code quality, and problem-solving skills.

3. **Task 3 - Problem Solving:** The third task involves solving problems and providing solutions. This is an opportunity to showcase my analytical and creative problem-solving skills.

The completion of these tasks will serve as a comprehensive representation of my capabilities, making this repository a vital part of my internship application.
